ruby.loadpaths =
# A semicolon-separated list of absolute paths to append to the default $LOAD_PATH.
# You can use this to add gems or other projects installed elsewhere.
# Default value is nothing.


# jruby.home = /Users/adam/bin/jruby-1.5.1
# If you want to install a lot of gems: instead of adding a loadpath for each one, 
# you can install them into a separate jruby installation and set jruby.home to
# run ajm.ruby against that jruby instead of the built-in one.
# This variable is not set by default.


ruby.initializers = ajm_ruby_initialize.rb
# A semicolon-separated list of files. 
# These files will be run in the order listed whenever a new ajm.ruby context is initialized.
# Default value is ajm_ruby_initialize.rb
