NOTES

Sequencing with good timing
  When using a [metro] to drive the sequencers, you should enable Overdrive
  from Max's Options menu. If Overdrive is not enabled, interacting with your
  Max patch (clicking a GUI object) can cause timing delays and ruin the
  sense of rhythm. This is normal Max scheduler behavior, so this advice
  applies whenever you need good timing from [metro].

Installing Ruby Gems for ajm.ruby 
  (1) Download JRuby 1.1.5 from http://jruby.codehaus.org
  (2) Add jruby/bin to your path. 
       From the OS X terminal or the Cygwin shell on Windows, run:
        $ export PATH=/path/to/jruby-1.1.5/bin:$PATH
        $ which gem
        /path/to/jruby-1.1.5/bin/gem   
  (3) Install gems as usual (see Ruby Gems documentation for details):
        $ gem install drp
  (4) Replace the {Max installation}/Cycling '74/java/lib/ruby folder with
      /path/to/jruby-1.1.5/lib/ruby
  (5) Restart Max/MSP
