NOTES

Sequencing with good timing
  When using a [metro] or [ajm.metro] to sequence music, you should enable
  Overdrive from Max's Options menu. If Overdrive is not enabled, interacting
  with your Max patch (clicking a GUI object) can cause timing delays and ruin
  the sense of rhythm. This is normal Max scheduler behavior, so this advice
  applies whenever you need good timing from [metro].

ADVANCED RUBY USAGE

Enabling Ruby 1.9 Support (Experimental)
  (1) Edit {Max installation}/Cycling '74/java/lib/ajm.ruby.properties
  (2) Change the ruby.version option from RUBY1_8 to RUBY1_9
  (3) Save the file and restart Max
  (4) The ajm.ruby help file should indicate it's running in Ruby 1.9 mode

Adding additional Ruby projects to the LOAD_PATH for ajm.ruby 
  (1) Edit {Max installation}/Cycling '74/java/lib/ajm.ruby.properties
  (2) Set the ruby.loadpaths option to a semicolon separated list of absolute
      paths, for example:
        ruby.loadpaths = /Users/username/projects/ruby/myproject
  (3) Save the file and restart Max
  (4) You should now be able to require your project in any script

Installing Ruby Gems for ajm.ruby
  (1) Download JRuby 1.3.1 from http://jruby.codehaus.org
  (2) Add jruby/bin to your path. 
       From the OS X terminal or the Cygwin shell on Windows, run:
        $ export PATH=/path/to/jruby-1.3.1 /bin:$PATH
        $ which jgem
        /path/to/jruby-1.3.1/bin/jgem   
  (3) Install gems as usual (see Ruby Gems documentation for details),
      but use the 'jgem' command instead of 'gem':
        $ jgem install midilib
			NOTE: you must install the midilib gem for ajm.midi2coll to function!
  (4) Replace the {Max installation}/Cycling '74/java/lib/ruby folder with
      /path/to/jruby-1.3.1/lib/ruby
  (5) Restart Max/MSP
