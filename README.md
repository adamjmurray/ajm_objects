# Status #

I've added some new objects, done a lot of testing, 
and more or less finished updating everything for Max 5. 
There's some new stuff related to sequencing MIDI with Max 5's transport system.

I'm gearing up for the next release pretty soon, version 0.8.5. 
It should be out by mid-December.

I've been meaning to do Cosy support for Max, but there's just too much still to
do in terms of feature work, debugging, and documentation. Although I already have an
ajm.cosy object here, it's not fully functional and I'm not going to try to finish it
for the 0.8.5 release. I will probably release an update to that separately later.

Still to do:

* More testing, especially on Windows
