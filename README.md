Adam Murray (adam@compusition.com)


## Status ##

Version 0.9.2 is the latest stable version, released on November 26, 2009.

<http://compusition.com/ajm-objects/ajm-objects-0.9.2.zip><br/>

Tested on OS X Leopard & Snow Leopard, Windows XP, and with Max for Live.


## Future ##

* ajm.ruby is being split off into a separate project at <http://github.com/adamjmurray/jruby_for_max> so I can focus on development of that object, and not require installation of all these objects for people who are only interested in scripting Max with Ruby.
