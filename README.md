## Status ##

Version 0.9.1 is the latest stable version, released on November 14, 2009.
<br/>
<http://compusition.com/ajm-objects/ajm-objects-0.9.1.zip><br/>

Tested on OS X Leopard & Snow Leopard, Windows XP, and with Max for Live.


## Future ##

* ajm.ruby will be split off into a separate project soon, because most people only use ajm objects
  for this one object. It will be easier for me to maintain and support one object.
